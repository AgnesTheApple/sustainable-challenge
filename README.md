HI! I ma a web dev student and so i decided to create my own web page to tell others my experience participating to the SUSTAINABLE CHALLENGE.
During 10 days i had to execute sustainable activities.
My web page will contain an intro, aboutMe, aboutTheChallenge, and dayByDay....
I found this project usefull to train my html and css knowledges and at the same time maybe share the message that we have to take care of our planet!
Thank you for read me!
