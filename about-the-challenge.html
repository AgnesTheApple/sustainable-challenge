			<p>As you understood, the Challenge's aim was to trigger sustainable actions by adding in the fun factor.</p>
			<p>The first step was to complete a start questionnaire that gave me an idea of what was my daily sustainable actions and in which field I could improve.</p>
		  <p>Then, for 2 week challenge, I had to keep track of my daily sustainable actions in an activity sheet, and send it to my friend at given times.</p>
		  <p>We also add a forum on What's App where we could share our daily actions with others players!</p>
		  <p>Because YES, it is a challenge, so we were severals participants didvided into 3 teams:</p>
		  	<ul>
		  		<li><strong>ITALIAN</strong> team (my team!)</li>
		  		<li><strong>NETHERLANDS</strong> team</li>
		  		<li><strong>AUSTRIA/GERMANY</strong> team</li>
		  	</ul>
		  <p>The Challenge was divided into 3 parts:</p>
			  <ul>
			  	<li><strong>Trial Period or Individual Challenge.</strong> Just 2 days to get familiar with the challenge...just to warm up!</li>
			  	<li><strong>Country Challenge,</strong> or how things start to be serious! All participants of each team were "competing" against each other! In other words we were all acting as sustainable as possible to get a maximum of points!</li>
			  	<li><strong>World Challenge</strong> Game on! It was time to show our sustainable best, using all actions that we were applying and sharing since a week. 50 participants, from differents countries, were, during those for 4 days , getting creative and acting more and more sustainable!</li>
				</ul>
				<p>That's it for the main rules! Now let's click on Activities to discover what I actually did!</p>
